# Stock Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project is a Jupyter notebook for predicting stock price movement (UP/DOWN) using technical analysis indicators and machine learning (Random Forest).

## Features

- Downloads historical stock data using [yfinance](https://github.com/ranaroussi/yfinance)
- Computes common technical indicators: SMA, EMA, RSI, MACD, and more (via [pandas_ta](https://github.com/twopirllc/pandas-ta))
- Labels price behavior as UP, DOWN, or SIDEWAYS for classification
- Trains a Random Forest classifier to predict UP/DOWN
- Tunes probability threshold for best recall/precision
- Compares model to Buy & Hold strategy via backtest
- Provides simple "BUY/HOLD" advice for the latest data
